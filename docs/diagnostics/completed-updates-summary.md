## Entry Template

```markdown
## Branch: `branch-name`

- **ID:** R-000
- **Owner:** Name
- **Target issue:** Short description of the issue.
- **Evidence status:** Confirmed / Code-plausible / Needs proof / UX improvement
- **Files changed:**
  - `path/to/file.ts`
- **Summary of fix:** What changed technically.
- **Validation performed:** Tests or manual checks already completed.
- **Remaining follow-up:** Anything still worth testing, merging, or improving.
```

## Branch: `fix/api-400-tool-messages`

- **ID:** R-001
- **Owner:** Abhinav Mehta
- **Target issue:** The agent could hang or throw an OpenRouter 400 error after several messages when a task involved background tool usage.
- **Evidence status:** Confirmed
- **Files changed:**
  - `packages/pixa-agent/src/agent/contextManager.ts`
- **Summary of fix:** Updated `pruneHistory` so context trimming no longer leaves orphaned tool-result messages without their corresponding assistant tool-call parent.
- **Validation performed:** Branch pushed; manual long-running tool-chat validation still should be recorded after merge.
- **Remaining follow-up:** Superseded structurally by R-006 turn-based pruning, but still an important prerequisite fix.

## Branch: `feat/chat-ui-revamp`

- **ID:** R-002
- **Owner:** Abhinav Mehta
- **Target issue:** The chat UI looked cluttered, and the proposed-changes approval list remained visible after files were applied or rejected.
- **Evidence status:** UX improvement
- **Files changed:**
  - `packages/pixa-agent/src/ui/webview/style.css`
  - `packages/pixa-agent/src/ui/webview/main.js`
- **Summary of fix:** Reworked the chat layout into a cleaner full-width block style, refined spacing and role tags, and filtered the proposed-changes panel to show only pending files.
- **Validation performed:** Branch pushed; visual inspection should be recorded after merge.
- **Remaining follow-up:** Confirm layout across narrow VS Code sidebars and common themes.

## Branch: `fix/chat-provider-resilience`

- **ID:** R-003
- **Owner:** Abhinav Mehta
- **Target issue:** Reloading VS Code or switching chats could hide tool-only assistant activity, and one failed file could break the entire Apply all action.
- **Evidence status:** Code-plausible
- **Files changed:**
  - `packages/pixa-agent/src/ui/chatViewProvider.ts`
- **Summary of fix:** Added transcript placeholders for assistant messages that used tools without readable text, made bulk apply continue after per-file failures, and posted inline status messages for applied/rejected/reverted changes.
- **Validation performed:** Branch pushed; reload/switch-session and bulk-apply failure cases still should be manually checked.
- **Remaining follow-up:** Add focused tests if the UI layer becomes easier to test.

## Branch: `feat/agent-task-state`

- **ID:** R-004
- **Owner:** Abhinav Mehta
- **Target issue:** Complex tasks could stop abruptly at the hard-coded 30-iteration limit.
- **Evidence status:** Code-plausible
- **Files changed:**
  - `packages/pixa-agent/src/agent/systemPrompt.ts`
- **Summary of fix:** Added a system-prompt directive telling the agent to maintain `.pixa/task-state.md` for large tasks and ask the user to continue across task boundaries.
- **Validation performed:** Branch pushed; long-task manual validation still should be recorded.
- **Remaining follow-up:** Consider a code-level continuation mechanism if prompt-only task state is insufficient.

## Branch: `feat/context-tool-result-summaries`

- **ID:** R-005
- **Owner:** Priyank Adhav
- **Target issue:** Under token pressure, old tool outputs were replaced with `[result truncated]`, causing context amnesia about previously read files, searches, or command output.
- **Evidence status:** Code-plausible
- **Files changed:**
  - `packages/pixa-agent/src/providers/types.ts`
  - `packages/pixa-agent/src/agent/loop.ts`
  - `packages/pixa-agent/src/agent/contextManager.ts`
  - `packages/pixa-agent/test/contextManager.test.ts`
- **Summary of fix:** Tool-result messages now retain their originating tool name, and pruning compresses old large tool outputs into structured summaries with tool name, original size, retained useful content, and recovery guidance.
- **Validation performed:** `npm run test -w pixa-agent -- contextManager.test.ts`; `npm run typecheck -w pixa-agent`.
- **Remaining follow-up:** Manually test with a tiny context budget and large `read_file`, `search_workspace`, and `run_command` outputs.

## Branch: `fix/turn-based-context-pruning`

- **ID:** R-006
- **Owner:** Priyank Adhav
- **Target issue:** Context pruning still removed history one message at a time, which could split logical conversation turns even after orphaned tool messages were avoided.
- **Evidence status:** Code-plausible
- **Files changed:**
  - `packages/pixa-agent/src/agent/contextManager.ts`
  - `packages/pixa-agent/test/contextManager.test.ts`
- **Summary of fix:** Replaced message-by-message front trimming with complete user-led turn pruning. Old user requests, assistant replies, tool calls, and tool results are now dropped as coherent units.
- **Validation performed:** `npm run test -w pixa-agent -- contextManager.test.ts`; `npm run typecheck -w pixa-agent`.
- **Remaining follow-up:** Manually validate a long multi-turn tool-using chat after R-001, R-005, and R-006 are merged in order.
